# WorldsHardestGameSpinoff

This [World's Hardest Game](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-worlds-hardest-game) spinoff has 4 challenging levels. You control a red block. In 
each level, you must make your way toward the goal (the green area) whilst avoiding the moving
enemy blocks. If you touch an enemy block, you must restart the level. Can you beat the game
with as few deaths as possible?

This project is made using the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library.
